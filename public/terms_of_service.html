<b>Short version:</b>
<br/>
A human must create your account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free account. You alone are responsible for your account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your account. You are responsible for keeping your account secure.
<br/>
<b>1. Required Information</b>
<br/>
You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a paid account, in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.
<br/>
<b>2. Account Requirements</b>
<br/>
You must be a human to create an account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
<br/>
A machine account is an account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free personal account.
One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will terminate that User’s account immediately. If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid organization account may create separate logins for as many users as its subscription allows.
Overall, the number of Users must not exceed the number of accounts you've ordered from us.
<br/>
<b>3. User Account Security</b>
<br/>
You are responsible for keeping your account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your account's security, but the content of your account and its security are up to you.
<br/>
You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your account (even when content is posted by others who have accounts under your account).
You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
You will promptly notify GitHub if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your account, including any unauthorized use of your password or account.
<br/>
<b>4. Additional Terms</b>
<br/>
In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.
<br/>
If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.
<br/>
If you have signed up for a Business plan, the Business Plan Addendum applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.
<br/>
If you are an owner or administrator of an Organization on GitHub, additional terms may govern your relationship with us and supersede this Agreement.
<br/>
<b>C. Acceptable Use</b>
<br/>
Short version: GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow this Acceptable Use Policy, which includes some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.
<br/>

<br/>
<b>2. Content Restrictions</b>
<br/>
